                    <i>The pursuit of strength required to perform aerial acrobatics is in many ways a quest to abolish softness, both physical through the literal hardening of muscles, and mental in expanding oneâ€™s own ideas of the possible, conquering fears, and challenging pain tolerances. And yet we ask<br>
                    may we entertain you<br>
                    with our softness</i><br><br><br></p>
                    
                    <p><b>PLAY (2019)</b><br><br>
                    In PLAY, the inagural soft cirque production, aerialists and musicians are brought together in a part rehearsed, part improvisation-based production. The aerialists, relying heavily on trained control as the basis of their ability to safely execute tricks, are each asked to prepare ~4 minutes of movement. The musicians are asked to play freely in response to their environment. On the evening of the show, aerialists and musicians combine their practices for the first time. Robbing the aerialists of song choice, usually a strong guiding force in the development of an act, imposes elements of both uncertainty and freedom. Each performer must fill the void left in the absence of the traditional choreographic driver. Spontaneity becomes imperative.<br><br>
                    
                    Aerialists: Laurie Bloom, Sara Odze, Aerial Mermaid, Sofya Shuster, Rachel Hjerpe, Astral Aerial, Lin Lin Feng, and Sandra Atakora. Music: Andrea Toftemark, Eric Zolan, and Marcelo Bonifato. Produced by Lin Lin Feng and Sandra Atakora.
